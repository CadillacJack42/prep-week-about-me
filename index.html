            <p class="intro-p basic">
                My name is Cadillac Jack. I hail from Las Vegas Nevada.
                I am 34 years old. I served 8 years in the military as Gunsmith.
                I have a 13 year old Daughter named, London.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-p interests">
                I enjoy watching movies/shows, reading, listening to music, and learning new things.
                I am a strong swimmer, but never swim in pools.
                I love going to concerts big or small, but not actually a fan of being in public.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-p ideas">
                I have many ideas that I would like to develop in software, as well as in the real world. 
                My ideas are generally about some form of charity. The idea itself may not be charible in nature,
                but the purpose of those ideas are to fund the ones which don't generate any cash flow.
                I've tried over the years to get some of them up and running, but find it hard to 
                meet anyone willing to help. I decided to no longer wait for a miracle to happen and 
                the only way my ideas will ever come to fruition is by my own hand, so I took up coding as a 
                means of jumpstarting my goals.

        <section id="second">Education
            <p class="edu-p basic">
                Education, in my opinion, is the single most valueable resource we have on this planet. 
                Education has the power to topple dynasties, while lack of an education can lead to subjugation.
                Education can feed a person for a lifetime.
                It is the most powerful tool we have as a society. This is why the most feared nations have 
                extensive intelligence branches, because Knowledge is power.

            <h3>The London Rae Foundation (LRF)</h3>
            <p>
                The LRF is a foundation designed to work towards improving the education experience
                for students of all backgrounds. Initially this will simply mean providing new
                clothes for each school year and providing food for all students. (Hard to concentrate when all you can think of is an
                empty stomach, or when you're embarrassed by the hole in your clothes from last year.)

        <section id="third">Music
            <div class="music-p basic">
                Music is the soul of time. You can hear pain and pleasure, love and hate, celebration and mourning
                throughout all time. Music can heal what medicine cannot touch. Music can bring people together in the 
                most divisive <div class="tooltip">moments.<p class="tooltip-text">(WW1 Christmas 1914 Germans began singing carols on the front lines and the british
                soldiers joined in. Shortly after there was a brief cease fire and the troops of both armies put down their weapons
                and celebrated Christmas together.)</p></div>

            <h3>Church of Music</h3>
            <p>
                A church is defined by any place a group of 3 or more people gather to study or practice
                an idealogy

            <p>
                The Church of Music is a fully equipped music studio meant to be a safe 
                place for students to gather after school and connect with likeminded 
                peoples for the purpose of developing themselves as artists or engineers
                in the music industry.

            Rehabilitation is something that we as a society have always had, but never really had. 
            Locking people in cages should not be our default way to handle rehabilitation.
